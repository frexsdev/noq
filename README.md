# Noq

Not [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/). Simple expression transformer that is not Coq.

## Quick Start

```console
$ cargo run ./examples/add.noq
```

## Main Idea

The Main Idea is being able to define transformation rules of symbolic algebraic expressions and sequentially applying them.

## Expression

Current expression syntax:

```
<expression> ::= <symbol> | <functor>
<symbol> ::= [a-zA-Z0-9]+
<functor> ::= <symbol> ( [<expression>],* )
```

## Rules and Shapes

The two main entities of the language are Rules and Shapes. A rule defines pattern (head) and it's corresponding substitution (body). The rule definition has the following syntax:

```
rule <name:symbol> <head:expression> = <body:expression>
```

Here is an example of a rule that swaps elements of a pair:

```
rule swap swap(pair(a, b)) = pair(b, a)
```

Shaping is a process of sequential applying of rules to an expression transforming it into a different expression. Shaping has the following syntax:

```
shape <expression>
  ... sequence of rule applications ...
done
```

For example here is how you shape expression `swap(pair(f(a), g(b)))` with the `swap` rule defined above:

```
shape swap(pair(f(a), g(b)))
  apply swap
done
```

The result of this shaping is `pair(g(b), f(a))`.

### Anonymous rules

You don't have to define a rule to use it in shaping. You can directly describe it after the `apply` keyword:

```
shape swap(pair(f(a), g(b)))
  apply rule swap(pair(a, b)) = pair(b, a)
done
```

Notice that we do not provide the rule name after the `rule` keyword.
